1,Does it make sense to swap testing and training datasets to train different models?
2,When will self-driving cars proliferate worldwide or in Singapore?
3,How do I know what dimensions to use? e.g. in the context of hands on ML example
4,Is there a process also to refine the data to train the machine to perform what it want?
5,How much data is enough data for ML?
6,"In data modelling contest, is there a selection matrix to determine what modelling is best for what type oil data?"
7,What's an example of multi-dimensional model-based prediction since linear is for 2 dimensions
8,How deep are we going into the different algorithms? Are we learning the mechanism behind k-means? Are we going to code it?
9,Is there a need for data to be normalized for certain models?
10,"So many algorithms, how do we know which one fits the problem best"
11,How do you best choose the value of k in KNN?
12,How can I apply Machine Learning in my domain of work?
13,"If there are other simpler solutions to a problem, will you choose to try ML to solve it first?"
14,Can a single prediction model be used to predict multiple target outcomes?
15,How much data is consider enough for training and testing?
16,How does PCA work?
17,Does the use of instance based learning also has the same limitation of overfitting - unable to generalise?
18,What are some methods for noise reduction?
