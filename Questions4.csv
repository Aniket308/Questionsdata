1,What actually happens in the self-attention layer of each Encoding layer?
2,Traditional NLP techniques have mainly evolved around English Language (i.e POS Tagging). Will machine learning enable us to move towards techniques that are more language independent?
3,how do we know which type of word embedding to use?
4,Does emogi recognition fall in the scope of NLP or CNN?
5,Does emogi recognition fall in the scope of NLP or CNN?
6,What actually happens in the self-attention layer of each Encoding layer?
7,"With Elmo, Bert and other complicated models, is there a reason (besides training time) to utilize a pure LSTM/RNN approach?"
